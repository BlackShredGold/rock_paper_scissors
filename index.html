		<h1>Rock, Paper Scissors</h1>
		<p>Right now this game is only playable in the developer console. Here are some notes about how it plays:</p>		
		<ol>
			<li>The game plays five total rounds against the computer (not best of five).</li>
			<li>If you tie with the computer, you get to do that round over.</li>
			<li>The program accepts "rock," "paper," or "scissors" as input. Input is not case sensitive.</li>
			<li>If you input any text other than the above, you will get an error and be prompted to try the round again.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Have fun!</p>
